    <h4>My History</h4>
    <div class="history"><p>I was born in Poland, as an only child to a single, very hard-working mother. I was interested in learning foreign languages since I was a little girl.
        When I was around seven years old I found an old Polish-English dictionary at my house and was "reading" it for hours.
        Next, when I was in primary school I was a huge fan of the german pop-rock band Tokio Hotel which encouraged me to study german.
        When I was in middle school I become a huge fan of Japanese rock music and was trying to learn Japanese on my own. Unfortunately, it was very challenging to find good and cheap study material and eventually forgo my Japanese language studying.
    When I was in high school I became a fan of K-pop, especially of the south-Korean band 2NE1. Unfortunately, my story of learning Korean is similar to the Japanese one. 
    Then YouTube and online stores came to help. My knowledge of the English language was good enough to buy my first learning Korean book. </br> </p> </div>
        <h4>Why do I study multiple languages?ðŸ“–</h4>
        <div class="languages">
        <p>I was always interested in different cultures. Living in a pretty homogenous country and a small city does not give many opportunities to interact with people from different cultures.
        I believe that every language is inherently connected to one's unique culture. For me learning different languages means getting to know these cultures.
    Being able to talk to people in their native language brings me closer to their culture, customs, and history.
I share my language journey on my <a href="https://www.instagram.com/maria.languages/" id="instagram">Instagram.</a></p></div>
